# duckweed-spp-composition
seeing what environmental factors are most influential in determining duckweed species composition--analyzed by presence/absence per species, richness, evenness, relative proportions

This branch was what was originally created on GitHub for the purpose of the biostatistics class. The data used here was preliminary, and the R file was majorly cleaned up for the purposes of creating the poster. So, I will leave this as is. Anything beyond this--eg, all data included, new statistical models run, etc, will go on the master branch or other branches.
